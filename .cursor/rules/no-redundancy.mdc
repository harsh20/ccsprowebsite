# No Redundancy

Before adding code, check whether it already exists in the project.

## Before you write

- New utility function → check `src/lib/` for existing helpers
- New icon mapping → check `src/lib/landing-icons.ts` before adding
- New type/interface → check `src/types/wordpress.ts` for similar shapes
- New shared UI pattern → check `src/components/landing/shared/` and `src/components/ui/`
- New fallback logic → reuse the mock-data-merge pattern established in `HomePage.tsx`

## While you write

- When the same Tailwind class pattern appears 3+ times across files, extract to a utility in `src/index.css`
- Remove unused imports and variables in every file you touch
- Do not create a new file for logic that belongs in an existing one

## What counts as duplication

- Two components rendering the same layout with minor prop differences → extract a shared component
- The same API-to-mock fallback chain repeated → use the established merge pattern
- Identical conditional rendering logic across sections → extract to a helper or shared component
