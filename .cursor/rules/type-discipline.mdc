# Type Discipline

Even though `tsconfig.json` has strict mode off, enforce these patterns.

## No `any`

Never use `any`. Use `unknown` with type guards, or define a proper interface. If a third-party type is truly untyped, cast through `unknown` with a comment explaining why.

## Explicit types

- All exported function parameters and return types must be explicit.
- All content structures must be typed — interfaces go in `src/types/wordpress.ts`.
- Mock data in `src/content/mockData.ts` must satisfy its declared type.

## Null safety

- Optional chaining must have a meaningful fallback, not silent `undefined` propagation.
- Use nullish coalescing (`??`) not logical OR (`||`) for API-to-mock merges. `||` swallows `0`, `""`, and `false`.

## Conventions

- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes.
- Import path alias: `@/` maps to `src/`.
- New interfaces go in `src/types/wordpress.ts`, not inline or scattered across component files.
