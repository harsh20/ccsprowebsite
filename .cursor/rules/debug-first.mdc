# Debug First

When something is broken or an error is reported, follow this process.

## 1. Read first

Read the full error output before proposing any fix. Do not guess from a partial message.

## 2. Root cause

Identify the root cause before writing any code. Trace the error back to its origin — do not fix symptoms.

## 3. Smallest fix

Propose the smallest possible fix that resolves the root cause. One targeted change is better than a broad refactor.

## 4. No opportunistic refactoring

Do not refactor surrounding code as part of a bug fix unless the bug is directly caused by the structure of that code.

## 5. Uncertain fixes

If the fix is uncertain, propose it as a hypothesis. Explain what to check to confirm it before applying. Format: "Hypothesis: [cause]. To confirm: [check]. Proposed fix: [change]."
