# Documentation Sync

When making substantive code changes, update relevant documentation in the same session.

## Required doc review

- Always review and update as needed:
  - `context.md`
  - `architecture.md`
  - `changelog.md`

## Update criteria

- Behavior changes: update architecture/data-flow descriptions.
- Type/API contract changes: update context/architecture type notes.
- Bug fixes: add concise `Fixed` item in `changelog.md`.
- New/changed workflows or conventions: update `claude.md`.

## Completion check

Before final response, confirm that any required markdown docs were updated or explicitly state why no doc changes were needed.
