# Build Verification

## Before editing

- Read relevant files before editing them.
- Do not batch unrelated changes in a single step.

## After editing

- After meaningful changes, run `npm run build` to verify TypeScript compilation.
- Run `ReadLints` on all edited files after edits.
- If build or lint fails, fix the issue before responding to the user.

## Type change impact

When changing types in `src/types/wordpress.ts`, also verify that consumers still compile:
- Components that import the changed type
- `src/content/mockData.ts`
- `src/hooks/useWordPress.ts`

## Judgment

This is judgment-based. A one-line text fix does not need a full build. A new component, type change, or structural refactor does.
