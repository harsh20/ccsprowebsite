# Scope Control

## Unlisted files need confirmation

Any file not listed in the task plan that Claude wants to touch requires explicit user confirmation before proceeding.

## Out-of-scope changes need approval

If a fix requires changes beyond the original scope, Claude must:
1. Stop
2. Explain what additional change is needed and why
3. Wait for confirmation before continuing

## No opportunistic cleanup

Do not refactor, rename, reorganize, or clean up anything not directly related to the current task unless explicitly asked.
